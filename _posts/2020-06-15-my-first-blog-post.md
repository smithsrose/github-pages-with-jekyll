title: What is the BEST type of paint?

Recently I've begun to paint more and experiment with different types and mediums. Around a month ago I started using gouache and let me tell you!
Gouach is absolutely amazing. Its the perfect mix of watercolor and acrylic! In my opinion is a painter wants the amazing solubility of watercolor yet with the opaqueness of acrylics, gouache is the paint for you.
Of course many may argue that oil is superior. And while it may be. In my personal opinion, gouache isn't as messy or expensive as oil. Oil reqires resin and varnishes and different mediums to use it at a prefered vicosity. 
SO in my opinion, I find gouache to be the pefect medium. Go check in out! Some brands I recommend for beginners are the "HIMI" Miya brand that sells JELLY gouache (Which is my personal favorite).
But if you'd like a more professional look, Winsor and Newton is of course the way to go.

I hope this helped you decide whether to try gouache or not!!
