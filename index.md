# Who am I?

My name is Smita Rosemary and I am 17 years old (I turned 17 during quarantine, so it ended up being uneventful). I run multiple social media accounts, some that I'm rather embarassed about T.T. You can contact me @smiths_rose on instagram or @RosemarySmita on Twitter. 


# Some things to Brag about
I worked my first job last year at Burger King, and the struggle is REAL. 
Some things I absolutely LOVE to do include painting and playing the piano. 
I've also received multiple NAACH trophies for dance and I'm quite proud of them.
